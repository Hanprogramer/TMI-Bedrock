# TMI-Bedrock
A mod that adds useful menu to show recipes and how to get items in the game. Also has a cheat mode in Creative mode to get any items you wanted, very useful for testing. The name "Too Many Items" is inspired by a [mod of the same name by Marglyph](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272385-toomanyitems-the-inventory-editor-and-more-1-8)

## Additional Information

Any textures placed into the textures/items will automatically be included into an `item_textures.json` file that is generated by `data/packs/RP/textures/item_texture.ts`. 

The icon identifier is determined by the file name, i.e. `textures/items/example_item.png` will become `amethyst_template:example_item`
